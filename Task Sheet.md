# Task Sheet

Within this course we will work on different practice tasks.
If you have trouble with any of the tasks you can always take a look at the cheat sheet or ask one of the trainers.

You should always be able to solve the normal tasks before we continue with the next one because some tasks build up on each other.
Please let us know if we go on too fast. 

Tasks with the advanced tag are not mandatory for the understanding and are only there to provide a challenge to those who finish the normal tasks early.
So don't worry if you have not finished the advanced stories in time. 

We will provide one possible solution for all tasks at the end of each day.

- Print out a story that contains each of the names multiple times.

## 2 Conditions

### 2.0 Personal Greeting


Hint: use if ... else

- Create a java class with the name "PersonalGreeting" in the module conditions.

- If the username is your own name display a special message.

### 2.1 Password Checker

Hint: use if ... else if ... else

- Create a java class with the name "PasswordChecker" in the module conditions.

- The program checks the password for at least two users and displays a message if the password is correct or not.
- If the user is not known display "The user is unknown."

### 2.2 Advanced Password Checker

## 3 Methods

### 3.0 Supermarket

- Create a java class with the name "Supermarket" in the module supermarket.
- Create a public static method called "calculateGrossPrice" that takes the net price and the tax rate and returns the gross price.
- Use this method to calculate the price of an apple and the price of a bottle of vine.

### 3.1 Recursive Fibonacci (advanced)

Hint: Recursive methods call them self. It is always important to have an interrupt condition using recursive calls.

- The Fibonacci series is a series in which each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. Example: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
- Create an executable program that takes a number and returns the Fibonacci number at this position using a recursive method.
- Think about why this recursive call can be problematic.
